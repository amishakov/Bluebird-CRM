{ts}You can control access to this report by selecting a 'Permission' from the list. You can also prevent users from modifying the default report criteria and filters for reports by NOT giving them <em>access Report Criteria</em> permission. Those users will be able to run the report - but only with the criteria and filters that you've established for them.{/ts}
